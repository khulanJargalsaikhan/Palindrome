# Palindrome

	/* A palindrome is a word, sentence or other type of character sequence which reads the same 
	 * backward as forward. For example, "Kayak" and "Anna" are palindromes. "Table" and "James" aren't 
	 * palindromes, because they don't read the same from left to right and from right to left. 
	 * 
	 * The problem can be stated along the following lines: given a string, return true if the string is 
	 * a palindrome and false if it isn't. Include spaces and punctuation in deciding if the string is a palindrome. 
	 * */
